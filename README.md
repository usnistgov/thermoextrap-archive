# Archival data for `thermoextrap`

[thermoextrap]: https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap

As [`thermoextrap`][thermoextrap] was being developed, several overly large jupyter notebooks made there way into the git history.  This made the repo bloated.  We spun off these old notebooks into this repo, and removed there history from `thermoextrap`. 


# Status

This repo is primarily archival.  While there are no plans to add new notebooks, as `thermoextrap` is further developed, some notebooks may find there way here.
